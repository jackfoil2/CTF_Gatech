#ROP ROP REVOLUTION
ROP ROP REVOLUTION is a Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge designed to test participants’ skills in Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) within a fun and engaging format. The challenge doesn’t rely on traditional flag strings but instead triggers a header file (flag.h) when solved correctly.
